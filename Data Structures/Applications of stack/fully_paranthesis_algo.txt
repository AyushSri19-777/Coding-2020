Postfix to fully paranthesised:
abc*d/+e-
((a+(b*c)/d))-e)
Algo:
Scan the postfix expression left to right

If opeartor is scanned
   to operand2 array,pop from stack and copy it
   to operand1 array,pop from stack and copy it
   to result, copy opening paranthesis
   to result, concatenate operand1
   to result, concatenate scanned operator in form of string
   to result, concatenate operand2
   to result, concatenate closing paranthesis
push result
else operand encountered push it into stack in form of string
